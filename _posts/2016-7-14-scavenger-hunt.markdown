From 10:30am - 1:00pm THIS Saturday, July 16th we will be having a photo scavenger hunt at St. Matthews Mall.

Sarah Ditch is planning a photo scavenging challenge throughout the mall which will take about an hour to an hour and a half. Once that is finished we will eat together at the food court so be sure to bring 5-10 dollars for lunch.

The winning group will get a delightful gift card to Starbucks.

**Pick up and drop off will be at the food court.**

Parents, we will need some chaperones to keep a watchful eye on people. Let us know if you can make it!
