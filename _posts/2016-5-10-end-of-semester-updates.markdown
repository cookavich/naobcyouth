LOTS (and lots) of stuff going on, so STICK with me through this post.

### Senior Adult Game Night

This Friday (May 13th) we will be joining with the senior adults for their game night (be prepared for a lot of Rook). This is one event we are particularly excited about. Our hope is that events like this will be a good opportunity for students to engage with older members of the congregation they might not have an opportunity to otherwise. 

Also, for those wishing to come, **the seniors have requested that we bring snacks and soda (in individual cans) with us to the event**.

### Sunday, May 15th
We have two Youth events and a final payment for camp coming up THIS Sunday. 

#### First
During the 9am service we will be recognizing our graduating seniors. 

#### Second 
Immediately after the second service we will be hosting a short parents meeting in the Youth room. During the meeting we will be going over the upcoming summer calendar, and would love to answer any questions you guys might have about camp or upcoming events.

#### Third - CAMP

*Also, as a reminder, final payment on camps are due May 15th, as well.*

###Worship Team Interest Meeting

Following BFG (that's what the kids call Sunday School these days) on Sunday, May 22nd, we will be having a Worship Team interest meeting at 12. It shouldn't take too long, but we want to be able to begin to organize a team for the Summer Youth Worship Nights.

So, students, if you're interested in serving in this way, please come! Parents, we'd love to have you, too.

### Kart Kountry
May 28th we will be going to Kart Kountry! 

We will meet up at the church around noon. *Departure time will be 12:00pm and we will return around 4pm*. Tickets will need to be purchased at Kart Kountry; you can find additional information about pricing here on the website (http://www.gokartkountry.com/rates.html). 

We are offering a discount for the first 25 people to sign up: **$6 for 2 tickets**. Just email Paul or Drew letting us know your coming.

#### Parents, please come!

We want you to school your kids in racing!
