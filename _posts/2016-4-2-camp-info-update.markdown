A few updates for camp this month.

1) Crossings Information Packets

Crossings has sent out a great information packet for parents and guardians laying out what you need to know about camp, get done for camp, and what you can expect for your student from camp. We highly recommend that you download and read this packet ASAP, and let Drew or Paul know if you have any more questions.

2) Don't forget to register your student for their POIs!

If you don't they will probably be decorating a cake everyday, and that will make them very sad. You can register your student at the link below:

[Register your student with Crossings](https://mail.crossingsministries.org/dandy2/Participant/Login "Register your student with Crossings")

3) Don't forget to fill out a medical release form!

You can register your student at the same link that you register your student for their POIs. Here's that link again:

4) Payments can be made via check to Drew or through this form:

5) There's still time to sign up your student for camp!

If you want your student to build closer relationships with other students their age in the church, then camp is a great thing for them to go to.

If you want your student to be able to take a break from TV, their phone, Snapchat, Instagram, video games, etc., then camp is a great thing for them to go to.

If you want your student to be able to spend focused time studying God's Word and hearing the Gospel preached and taught, then camp is a great thing for them to go to.

We want to encourage you that if you're on the fence about sending your son or daughter to camp, to send them. It has been a formative experience for many in their spiritual lives, and it could be so for your student. If you have any questions or concerns, please talk to Drew, Paul, or Philip Brown.

You can register your student for camp at the link below:
