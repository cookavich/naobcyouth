As you've hopefully already heard, we are shifting the date of the split games that we had scheduled for Saturday the 23rd of this month to the very next day, Sunday the 24th.
 
Without realizing it we scheduled our event for the same day as Thunder Over Louisville. We know many of our families enjoy attending this event (as do we) so we want to remove the option of having to choose between spending time together with your family at Thunder and a church event. The last thing that we want to do as a ministry is to come between you and your quality family time. 

With that in mind, we have rescheduled the event as has already been mentioned via email and above. 

The new date and time is:

Sunday, April 24th, from 1:30 - 4:30 at 9th and O.

The girls will be having a great time indoors making things together, and the guys will be having a great time outdoors shooting each other with slingshots and paintballs.

Hope to see you there!
