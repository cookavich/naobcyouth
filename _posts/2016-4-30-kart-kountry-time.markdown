Reminder for everyone to mark your calendars for ourgit  end of the semester Kart Kountry outing on May 28th.

Departure time from the church is at 12:00pm, and we'll be getting back to the church around 4:00pm.

Rumor has it that Drew has been visualizing the finish line in preparation for the day so don't be afraid of a little bumping.

### Parents, we would love to have you! 

Come hang out and beat your children in various games and races.
