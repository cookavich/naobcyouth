Come join us for an awesome time at Holiday World!

When: Saturday, July 30th
Price: $20 per ticket (plus the cost of any souvenirs and two meals)

We will leave the church around 10am that Saturday, and then return around 7:30/7:45 that night. We’ll be having lunch at the park, and then eat dinner at Wendy’s on the way back to 9th and O.

We’ll be sending out a mailer to make sure everyone is aware soon.

Contact Drew or Paul if you want to come!
