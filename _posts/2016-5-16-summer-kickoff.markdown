Sid Fogle has been gracious enough to invite the youth ministry to his house for a little start of the summer soiree. 

There will be games, tasty homemade corndogs, snacks, and fellowship. Come hang out with us, and celebrate school being out for summer.
 
**Date:** June 4th, 2016
**Time:** 5pm-8pm
**Location:** Sid's House, of course

We do ask that you bring with you a side or a dessert.

Can't wait to see you there!
